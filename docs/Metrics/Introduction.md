# Introduction

Metrics give you an idea of your environment and gives you data, which you can use for decisions.

In **this section** we will go over the **Server Metrics** and **Explorer**.
There are other metrics available in Intersight and you can explorer those on your own.
**Fabric Interconnect**, **Chassis** do have different metrics which can be viewed when you click on them or in **Explorer**.
