This training document is to familiarize with Cisco Intersight and UCS X-Series nodes. Although the lab design and configuration examples could be used as a reference, itâ€™s not a real design, thus not all recommended features are used, or enabled optimally. For the design related questions please contact your representative at Cisco, or a Cisco partner.
