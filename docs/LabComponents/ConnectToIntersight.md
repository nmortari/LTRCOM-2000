# Task 1: Connect To Intersight

You can connect with the laptop to Intersight and do all tasks in this lab.
For this lab, every participant will have one physical server to configure.

**NOTE:**
**DO NOT CHANGE THE CHASSIS or DOMAIN POLICIES.**
7 Persons next to you won’t be able to work on their lab.

The lab gear consists of 4 clusters which exist of an FI pair, a UCSX-9508 chassis and 8x UCSX-210c-M6 nodes, all connecting to a top of rack switch. 

**NOTE:**
Servers can have different CPUs, memory and Storage configuration. Even though these differences, every server has an M.2 drive to install the OS on and every task will work on any server.
